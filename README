 bin2dbyorbit.m

 Matlab/GNU Octave functions to bin a list of cartesian data points and 
 return 2D arrays. Intended for mapping point-based data from instruments
 aboard spacecraft.

 These functions was written to process point-based (rather than 
 image-based) spacecraft data obtained by an instrument operating in
 pushbroom mode. The purpose is to fill in data gaps on gridded data 
 products where point density is low, but to first create contiguous orbit
 tracks on the target grid, before stacking those.

 Binning is performed intially within orbit tracks. For output grids with 
 the suffix 'Interp', Delauney triangulation is used to fill bins between 
 points in the interior of each orbit track. This minimizes the number of 
 empty bins the output grids. Grids entitles 'cnt', and 'err' represent
 the raw, non-interpolated data.

 A point density map on the target grid is calculated for points in each 
 orbit using the parameter, 'neighbourhood', a positive odd integer
 describing the length of the square side that defines a neighbourhood on
 the grid. Typically, 3 <= neighbourhood <= 7 for best results.

 Where there are empty points on the target grid and the density exceeds
 the density threshold (passed as densityThresh) grid cells are
 interpolated. 'neighbourhood' and 'densityThresh' should therefore be 
 tuned according to the expected point density and the resolution of the 
 target grid.
 
 Usage:
 
 [tavgInterp,tcnt,terr,tminInterp,tmaxInterp] = ...
    bin2dbyorbit(x,y,t,xedges,yedges,orbit, neighbourhood, densityThresh)

 Grids produced:

     Interpolated average        (tavgInterp)
     number of points per bin    (tcnt)
     standard deviation per bin  (terr)
     minimum value               (tminInterp)
     maximum value               (tmaxInterp)

 bin2dwbyorbit.m

 Function to bin variable t, that has weight w, at locations (x, y) onto a 
 cartesian grid and return 2D arrays of various statistical measures.

 This function was written to process point-based (rather than 
 image-based) spacecraft data obtained by an instrument operating in
 pushbroom mode. The purpose is to calculate various quantities for a vector of
 data points, t, whose  location is defined by 2D coordinates, x,y, and weight,
 w. 
 
 The weighted mean and error on the weighted mean is first calculated for data 
 within each orbit track. At this point the routine offers the possibility to
 1) Remove disconnected outlying data points that have a low weight from each 
    orbit track.
 2) Interpolate only for areas where data density is sufficient, within each 
    orbit track.
 After these steps, orbit tracks are combined to produce a mapped data product.

 For output grids with the suffix 'Interp', Delauney triangulation is used to 
 fill bins between points in the interior of each orbit track. This minimizes 
 the number of empty bins the output grids. Grids without 'Interp' in the name
 represent non-interpolated data.

 To perform this quality control a data density map is calculated. The 
 parameter, 'neighbourhood', is a positive odd integer describing the length of
 the square side that defines a neighbourhood on the grid.
 Typically, 3 <= neighbourhood <= 7 for best results.

 Where there are empty points on the target grid and the observation 
 density exceeds the density threshold (passed as densityThresh) bins are
 interpolated. 'neighbourhood' and 'densityThresh' should therefore be 
 tuned according to the expected point density and the resolution of the 
 target grid.
 
 Usage:
 	
 [tmeanInterp, tcnt, sumw, terr, tmin, tmax] = ...
    bin2dwbyorbit(x,y,t,w,xedges,yedges,orbit,neighbourhood,densityThresh)
 	
 
 Grids produced:

     Interpolated average        (tmeanInterp)
     number of points per bin    (tcnt)
     sum of weight per bin       (tsumw)
     standard deviation per bin  (terr)
     minimum value               (tminInterp)
     maximum value               (tmaxInterp)
